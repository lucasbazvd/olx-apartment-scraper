# OLX Apartment Scraper

## Idea
I would like to build a web application with a Map that's gonna show me the apartments available to rent in the city of Curitiba, from the famous Brazilian Website called <b>olx.com.br</b>.  This map should be interactive and as I click in some street, it shoud show to me all the available apartments and more info about it. The map must have neighborhood geometries, and street geometries.

For this, I would like to build an API to serve data to my Front End, and use Mapbox JS to build the map. The web scraping .py file is basically done, with just some adjustments needed.
